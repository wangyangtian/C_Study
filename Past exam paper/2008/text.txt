I hope this letter finds you well. As the project coordinator for the "Aiding Rural Primary School" initiative, I am writing to provide you with further details regarding your inquiry.
The project is scheduled to take place at Hope Primary School from November 1 to December 31. The two main activities include donating essential educational materials and offering one-on-one tutoring sessions to students. Volunteers like you will have the opportunity to engage with students, sharing knowledge and nurturing their love for learning. We are especially seeking volunteers with strong English skills to assist in language instruction. It promises to be a cause filled with memorable experiences.
We sincerely appreciate your dedication to this meaningful cause. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
