Tennis is known as the second most popular game in the world and is loved by people for its intense enjoyment and exciting competitive process. In recent years, as the popularity of tennis has continued to grow and the number of people playing the game has increased, its event metrics have been refined. Especially for large-scale events, we will be able to access the technical levels of athletes on both sides of the game, and the amount of data on these metrics is already extremely large and detailed. The data will support us to obtain more accurate prediction results through efficient event prediction methods. Youthful Spanish rising star Carlos Alcaraz has beaten veteran Novak Djokovic in the final of the 2023 Wimbledon Gen-tlemen's matches. In the first set, Djokovic broke back-to-back for a 5-0 lead and went on to take the first set easily. In the second set, Alcaraz found his form and immediately broke back after being broken by Djokovic to level the game at 6-6. With the last ball of the tiebreak, Alcaraz went straight to deuce and hit a clutch shot to win the set 7-6 in a thriller. In the third set, Alcaraz broke Djokovic's first service game and Djokovic was out of sorts, losing the set. In the fourth set, Djokovic again began to dominate and took the set 6-3 to level the match at 2-2. In the third game of the deciding set, Alcaraz broke for the lead and with Djokovic out of control and off balance, the Spanish star gradually worked his way into the game to win 6-4. The match was a matchless battle, and we were also concerned that there seemed to be a relationship between the dominance of the players in the match and the "momentum".
